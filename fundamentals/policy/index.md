## Guiding Policy

> Never tell people how to do things.  Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.  
> **George S. Patton**

Once you’ve got a diagnosis, you need to determine what to do — the actions to take.  But this is not very straight-forward.

You need to be guided by principles and a general approach.  Then when you plan action and implement them, you are able to determine if and when you are making progress and make course corrections.

That is the utility of guiding policy.

## Coherent Action

> The impediment to action advances action.  What stands in the way becomes the way.  
> **Marcus Aurelius**

Otherwise, you’re just shooting in the dark.

Use the diagnosis and the guiding policy as the light to design action to get out of the darkness and walk straight and fast.

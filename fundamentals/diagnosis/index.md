## Diagnosis

> There are two ways to be fooled.  One is to believe
what isn’t true.  The other is to refuse to believe what is true.  
> **Søren Kierkegaard**

Once you are clear what you’re trying to accomplish, it is easier to figure out what is standing in the way — the obstacle.

Diagnosis includes gaining clarity on both — your purpose and the obstacle.  It is a search for the truth in the situation.

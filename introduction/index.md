* [The Kernel of Good Strategy](kernel)
* [Hunters and Farmers](hunters)
* [Success](success)

Strategy is about how we act.  It is about how we decide on and achieve our aims.  We have to ask critical questions.

* What are we trying to accomplish?
* Why and how did we decide on that?
* Do we have any obstacles?
* What is really important here?

Then we attempt to gain clarity and focus in order to orient ourselves to avoid distractions and make progress.

* What kind of policy could guide us?
* Can we act coherently over time?

Strategy, ultimately, is about how we win, how we succeed.
